Sweetly Broken

Verse 1:
To the cross I look
To the cross I cling
Of its suffering I do drink
Of its work I do sing

Verse 2:
For on it my Savior 
Both bruised and crushed
Showed that God is love
And God is just

Chorus:
At the cross You beckon me
You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
Lost for words, so lost in love
I’m sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

What a priceless gift
Undeserved life
Have I been given
Through Christ crucified

You’ve called me out of death
You’ve called me into life
And I was under Your wrath
Now through the cross I'm reconciled

(Chorus)

In awe of the cross I must confess
How wondrous Your redeeming love and
How great is Your faithfulness

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
